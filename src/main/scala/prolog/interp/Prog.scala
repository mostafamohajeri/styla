/**
 * The class Prog implements instances of Prolog interpreters, wrapped up as self-contained
 * first-class LogicEngines, usable as Scala or Akka actors. It is parameterized by a
 * DataBase object containing Prolog clauses. A default library encapsulated
 * as a Scala class in file Lib.scala is added automatically when a DataBase object is
 * created by a TermParser from a source file.
 * 
 * A Prog uses two stacks. 
 * 
 * The orStack is implemented as a mutable ObjectStack that
 * handles backtracking.
 * 
 * A List-represented goal stack that contains the current
 * resolvent for a given choice. 
 * 
 * The goal-stack is pushed/popped as needed from the
 * the orStack but being represented as an immutable List its tail is actually shared
 * so this operation is quite efficient. The underlying model is the unfolding of a
 * predicate head present in a goal atom into its body. The clause, once matched, is copied
 * and its body occupies the top of the goal stack. As variables on the goal stack end up
 * being shared between alternative or branches, a trail, unique to a Prog is used to
 * record binding of variables that ere undone on backtracking. This is handled 
 * by the related Unfolder class, which also executed built-in sequences hanging between
 * genuine Prolog predicates.
 * 
 * All built-ins are deterministic, implemented as Scala functions and as such 
 * no backtracking is implemented within them, except that they trail variable bindings.
 * As they are never pushed on a stack, they are incur no space overhead.
 * 
 * To speed-up built-in calls, a simple reflection mechanism is used at parsing time
 * when their string names are associated to the corresponding Scala objects and then
 * cached in a Map. The convention is that all built-ins are hosted in the package
 * prolog.builtins. This allows the parser to instantly recognize them, without any
 * glue code needed for calling them at runtime through an exec() method.
